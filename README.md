Note this is all client-side, the usernames you search for are never sent to any server. The app works offline, after you load it. I dont even have a server to send the data anywhere !!!!

## Gmail Username Rules

- Allowed characters: a-z, 0-9, _, - (periods are ignored for uniqueness)
- Cannot start or end with _, or -
- Cannot have consecutive _, or - characters
- Usernames are not case-sensitive
- Periods are ignored for uniqueness (e.g., john.doe@gmail.com is the same as johndoe@gmail.com)

## This project was forked from Every Password which was forked from Every SSN which is forked from Every UUID

This is forked from the really cool project that is [everyuuid.com](https://everyuuid.com) which solved all the hard problems to make this happen and r [Every-password.github.io](https://solst-ice.github.io/every-password/) that inspired this one. I mean without username... maybe the password is useless.. you know!
